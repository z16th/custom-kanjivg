# Custom KVG

## Description

This is my take (@z16th) on modifying the KVG files for web manipulation.

- Remove invalid HTML tags (issues with parsers and libraries)
- Convert `<g>` (StrokePaths and StrokeNumbers) inline styles to css classes
- Convert `kvg` attributes into `data-*` attributes

## Instructions

Run `node .` to generate automatically the new files.
You can change the script to output them anywhere you want, by default it uses `./output`

I used Node v16.17.0 but should work fine on any recent versions.

### Use with css

If you run the script as-is the generated svgs will need the default style to look good.
Use the rules inside `example/style.css` to load the default styles or make your own based on those rules.

### Use your own inline styles

You can change the `replace` methods in the script to provide your own styles and create the new files with hardcoded styles.
